Here is an example:\n```\nimport os\n\nresponse = os.system(\"ping -c 1 www.google.com\")\n\nif response == 0:\n    print(\"Ping successful\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Ping failed\")\n```\nThis code will send a single ping to `www.google.com` and print \"Ping successful\" if the ping is successful, or \"Ping failed\" if it is not. The `-c` option specifies the number of pings to send, and the `os.system` function runs the command and returns the exit code. In this case, an exit code of 0 indicates success, and any other value indicates failure.\n\nYou can replace `www.google.com` with the address of the server you want to ping. Keep in mind that this code will only work on Unix-like systems, such as Linux and macOS. On Windows, you can use the `ping` command from the `subprocess` module instead:\n```\nimport subprocess\n\nresponse = subprocess.run([\"ping\", \"-n\", \"1\", \"www.google.com\"], capture_output=True)\n\nif response.returncode == 0:\n    print(\"Ping successful\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Ping failed\")\n```\nThis code is similar to the previous example, but it uses the `subprocess.run` function to run the `ping` command and capture its output. The `-n` option specifies the number of pings to send, and the `returncode` attribute of the `response` object contains the exit code of the command. As before, an exit code of 0 indicates success, and any other value indicates failure.\n\nDo you have any other questions about pinging servers in Python?"}]}]
