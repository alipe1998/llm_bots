Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. The script imports the `json` module, which is used to parse JSON data.\n2. Several variables are defined to set up the SharePoint site URL, the name of the document library to search within, the API endpoint for the search query, and the user's search query.\n3. The `query_params` dictionary is created to hold the parameters for the search query. It includes the search query text, the fields to select in the results (\"Title,\" \"Description,\" and \"FileLeafRef\"), and a row limit of 10 results.\n4. The `headers` dictionary is set up with the necessary headers for the request, including the \"Accept\" header specifying the desired response format and the \"Authorization\" header with the access token for authentication.\n5. The script uses the `requests` library to send a GET request to the SharePoint site's API endpoint, passing the headers and query parameters.\n6. If the response status code is 200 (indicating a successful request), the script parses the JSON response data using `response.json()`.\n7. The script accesses the relevant part of the JSON response by navigating through the nested dictionary structure to reach the \"results\" list within the \"Rows\" section.\n8. The script then iterates through the \"results\" list, extracting the values for \"Title\" and \"Path\" from each result's \"Cells\" list. It uses a generator expression with the `next` function to find the first cell with the specified key (\"Title\" or \"Path\").\n9. For each result, the script prints the title and path.\n10. If the response status code is not 200, the script prints an error message along with the status code and the response text.\n\nOverall, this script demonstrates how to use the SharePoint search API to retrieve and display search results from a specific document library within a SharePoint site."}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"text": "can i rewrite this to use query params argument in sharepoint:\n\n```\n# Define your SharePoint site, list name, and search query\nsite_url = \"https://papedawson.sharepoint.com\"\nlist_name = \"proposal_metadata\"  # Replace with your list name\ncolumn_name = \"field_3\"  # Replace with the column name you want to search\nsearch_query = \"Parker\"  # Replace with the keyword you're searching for\n\n# Construct the REST API endpoint URL\nendpoint = f\"{site_url}/sites/APITest/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('{list_name}')/items?$filter=substringof('{search_query}', {column_name})\"\n\n# Set up your headers, including the Authorization header with your access token\nheaders = {\n    \"Accept\": \"application/json;odata=verbose\",\n    'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'\n}\n\n# Make the GET request to the SharePoint REST API\nresponse = requests.get(endpoint, headers=headers)\n\n# Check the response\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    items = response.json()\n    print(items)\n    # Process your search results\n    for i, item in enumerate(items['d']['results']):\n        print(f\"Title: {item.get('Title', 'N/A')}\")\n        print(f\"Opportunity Name: {item.get('field_3', 'N/A')}\")\n        print(f\"{item.get('field_4', 'N/A')}\")\n        print(f\"{item.get('field_5', 'N/A')}\")\n        print(f\"{item.get('field_6', 'N/A')}\")\n        print(f\"{item.get('field_7', 'N/A')}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}\")\n```"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"text": "Yes, you can modify the code to use query parameters in the SharePoint REST API request.
